Description: TumourMethData collects tumour methylation data from a variety of different tumour types (and also matching normal samples where available) and produced with different technologies (e.g. WGBS, RRBS and methylation arrays) and provides them as RangedSummarizedExperiments, facilitating easy extraction of methylation data for regions of interest.
